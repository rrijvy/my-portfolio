            I'm a dedicated software engineer with a lifelong passion for technology. My journey
            began with a fascination for computer as a child, which naturally led me to pursue
            studies in the Faculty of Science.

            For the past four years, I've been fortunate to work as a software engineer at a reputed
            company in Bangladesh, where I thrive on learning new technologies and applying them to
            solve complex problems. My commitment to continuous improvement and innovation drives me
            to stay at the forefront of the tech industry.

            Outside of my professional life, I enjoy reading, playing cricket, and spending quality
            time with my family and two cats. These activities help me maintain a well-rounded and
            balanced lifestyle.
