        <p class="text-2xl">
          Fascinated with electronics since childhood. From there, I studied in the Faculty of
          Science, then studied computer science and engineering at the university, and now I have
          established myself as a software engineer. I love to learn new things and implement them,
          that's my passion. Although I am more curious about space but never got to know well due
          to lack of sources. However, I have been working as a software engineer for the past 4
          years in a reputed company in Bangladesh. When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually
          reading, playing cricket or hanging out with my family and two cats.
